# About

This repo implements Particle Gibbs sampler for Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) written in Rust.

Python bindings and integration with PyMC and Numpyro (coming soon) are also provided.

To use the model in PyMC, you can simply write

```python
with pm.Model() as model_coal:
    μ_ = rust_pgbart.BART("μ_", X=x_data, Y=y_data, m=20)
    μ = pm.Deterministic("μ", np.abs(μ_))
    y_pred = pm.Poisson("y_pred", mu=μ, observed=y_data)
    idata_coal = pm.sample()
```

See `examples` for the full code. 

# Code organization

- `pgbart/src` contains the generic implementation of the Particle Gibbs sampler. 
It does not have any notion of Python or PyMC. It only assumes you can provide the input data (`X`, `y`) and
a function `logp(predictions) -> float`.
- `bindings/` contains the Rust + Python + PyMC bindings code. See its `README.md` for details. 

# Todo

This is a work in progress

- [ ] Out-of-sample predictions (Rust code is there, need to expose it in python)
- [ ] Variable importance plots (Rust code is there, nede to expose it in python)
- [ ] Partial dependence plots 
- [ ] Tests and CI
- [ ] Docs
- [ ] Numpyro integration
- [ ] Support `ND` targets
- [ ] Support `NaNs`
- [ ] PyPI package?

# Building

See `./bindings/README.md`


# Credits

I've developed this code as part of my effort to re-write [Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python](https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/welcome.html) into `numpyro`.

The implementation was based on:
- BART implementation [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03619)
- [Original PyMC implementation](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-bart/tree/0f0e3617ac03877448f5eded315e8cb810d1d0cb)
- [nutpie](https://github.com/pymc-devs/nutpie/tree/9029f9167496ad72fcd56975e56836798da75e0d)
